Statute of Anne: Preparer's Notes

Created from various public domain versions.


Repetition of last words on pages eliminated,
Latin intro and extro translated into English.
End of line hyphenations removed for searching.
Typo of "peny" for "penny" has been corrected,
with the elimination of the accompanying sic.
Also "seasonable" replaced by "reasonable" with
the removal of that sic, as well.  "Queens" is
replaced with "queen's", and "majesties" would
become "majesty's", "entred" becomes "entered"
and these typos were often in multiple places.

"Vice-Chancellors" and "Vice Chancellors" both
appeared so I chose "Vice Chancellors" just to
make searches more simple.

I have not changed any of the apparently quite
random capitalizations [random in comparisons,
I should say to German, etc.], nor changed any
of the more different spellings, as inhaunced.

I would like to comment just how obvious it is
that the rights of the authors was an "add on"
to this document, taking place only on a sixth
sheet containing only two small paragraphs, as
this makes it even more obvious just how every
right was originally for "The Stationers," who
are now descended as by The World Intellectual
Property Organization through various means.

This law was proposed and defeated 250 years--
from its first draft by The Stationers just as
The Gutenberg Press got going to this period.

All monarchs, and Oliver Cromwell, refused it,
on grounds it gave too much to The Stationers,
and left too little to the public, as per:

Henry VI        1 Sep 1422    4 Mar 1461
Edward IV       4 Mar 1461    9 Apr 1483
[Henry VI - restored 9 Oct 1470 to c. Apr 1471]
Edward V        9 Apr 1483   25 Jun 1483
Richard III    26 Jun 1483   22 Aug 1485
Henry VII      22 Aug 1485   21 Apr 1509
Henry VIII     22 Apr 1509   28 Jan 1547
Edward VI      28 Jan 1547    6 Jul 1553
Mary            6 Jul 1553   24 Jul 1554
Philip & Mary  25 Jul 1554   17 Nov 1558
Elizabeth I    17 Nov 1558   24 Mar 1603
James I        24 Mar 1603   27 Mar 1625
Charles I      27 Mar 1625   30 Jan 1649
Commonwealth   30 Jan 1649   29 May 1660
Charles II     [30 Jan 1649]  6 Feb 1685
James II        6 Feb 1685   11 Dec 1688
William & Mary 13 Feb 1689    8 Mar 1702
                 [Mary died  27 Dec 1694]
William III    27 Dec 1694    8 Mar 1702
Anne            8 Mar 1702    1 Aug 1714


Please note that this 250 year span included reigns
from the son of Henry V of Shakespearian fame and a
greater Shakespearian epic of Richard III, to those
six wives of Henry VIII, Mary Queen of Scots, and a
host of the most turbulent reigns of UK history and
in all this time not one of these rulers would give
The Stationers such great power that has now passed
down, not only unchecked, but greatly enhanced over
the next 300 years.  The average copyright moved to
about 100 years in length in that time from 15 year
average original terms [nearly none were renewed].

My own words are mine alone, though I appreciate it
when people offer corrections, advice, etc., though
I don't always take it.  However, I do always offer
to publish their own version along with mine.

In The Eighth Year Of The Reign Of Queen Anne.



An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of
Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the
Times therein mentioned.

Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late
frequently taken the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting, and Publishing, or
causing to be Printed, Reprinted, and Published Books, and other
Writings, without the Consent of the Authors or Proprietors of such
Books and Writings, to their very great Detriment, and too often to the
Ruin of them and their Families: For Preventing therefore such Practices
for the future, and for the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and
Write useful Books; May it please Your Majesty, that it may be Enacted,
and be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty, by and with the
Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in
this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same,
That from and after the Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven hundred
and ten, the Author of any Book or Books already Printed, who hath not
Transferred to any other the Copy or Copies of such Book or Books, Share
or Shares thereof, or the Bookseller or Booksellers, Printer or
Printers, or other Person or Persons, who hath or have Purchased or
Acquired the Copy or Copies of any Book or Books, in order to Print or
Reprint the same, shall have the sole Right and Liberty of Printing such
Book and Books for the Term of One and twenty Years, to Commence from
the said Tenth Day of April, and no longer; and that the Author of any
Book or Books already Composed and not Printed and Published, or that
shall hereafter be Composed, and his Assignee, or Assigns, shall have
the sole Liberty of Printing and Reprinting such Book and Books for the
Term of fourteen


page 2

Years, to Commence from the Day of the First Publishing the same, and no
longer; And that if any other Bookseller, Printer, or other Person
whatsoever, from and after the Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven
hundred and ten, within the times Granted and Limited by this Act, as
aforesaid, shall Print, Reprint, or Import, or cause to be Printed,
Reprinted, or Imported any such Book or Books, without the Consent of
the Proprietor or Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing,

Signed in the Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses; or knowing the
same to be so Printed or Reprinted, without the Consent of the
Proprietors, shall Sell, Publish, or Expose to Sale, or cause to be
Sold, Published, or Exposed to Sale, any such Book or Books, without
such Consent first had and obtained, as aforesaid, Then such Offender or
Offenders shall Forfeit such Book or Books, and all and every Sheet or
Sheets, being part of such Book or Books, to the Proprietor or
Proprietors of the Copy thereof, who shall forthwith Damask and make
Waste-Paper of them: And further, That every such Offender or Offenders,
shall Forfeit One Penny for every sheet which shall be found in his,
her, or their Custody, either Printed or Printing, Published or Exposed
to Sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Act, the one
Moiety thereof to the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, Her Heirs and
Successors, and the other Moiety thereof to any Person or Persons that
shall Sue for the same, to be Recovered in any of Her Majesty's Courts
of Record at Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or
Information, in which no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege, or
Protection, or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.

And whereas many Persons may through Ignorance Offend against this Act,
unless some Provision be made whereby the Property in every such Book,
as is intended by this Act to be Secured to the proprietor or
Proprietors thereof, may be ascertained, as likewise the Consent of such
Proprietor or Proprietors for the Printing or Reprinting of such Book or
Books may from time to time be known; Be it therefore further Enacted by
the Authority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to extend to subject any Bookseller, Printer, or other Person
whatsoever, to the Forfeitures or Penalties therein mentioned, for or by
reason of the Printing or Reprinting of any Book or Books without such
Consent, as aforesaid, unless the Title to the Copy of such Book or
Books hereafter Published shall, before such Publication be Entered, in
the Register-Book of the Company of Stationers, in such manner as hath
been usual, which Register-Book shall at all times be kept at the Hall
of the said Company, and unless such Consent of the Proprietor or
Proprietors be in like manner Entered, as aforesaid, for every of which
several Entries, Six Pence shall be Paid, and no more; which said
Register-Book may, at all Reasonable and Convenient times, be Resorted
to, and Inspected by any Bookseller, Printer, or other Person, for the
Purposes before mentioned, without

Page 3

any Fee or Reward; and the Clerk of the said Company of Stationers,
shall, when and as often as thereunto required, give a Certificate under
his Hand of such Entry or Entries, and for every such Certificate, may
take a Fee not exceeding Six Pence.

Provided nevertheless, That if the Clerk of the said Company of
Stationers, for the time being shall Refuse or Neglect to Register, or
make such Entry or Entries, or to give such Certificate, being thereunto
Required by the Author or Proprietor of such Copy or Copies, in the
Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses, That then such Person and
Persons so refusing, Notice being first duly given of such Refusal, by
an Advertisement in the Gazette, shall have the like Benefit, as if such
Entry or Entries, Certificate or Certificates had been duly made and
given; and that the Clerks so refusing, shall, for any such Offence,
Forfeit to the Proprietor of such Copy or Copies the Sum of Twenty
Pounds, to be Recovered in any of Her Majesty's Courts of Record at
Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information, in which
no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege or Protection, or more than one
Imparlance shall be allowed.

Provided nevertheless, and it is hereby further Enacted by the Authority
aforesaid, That if any Bookseller or Booksellers, Printer or Printers,
shall, after the said Five and twentieth Day of March, One thousand
seven hundred and ten, set a Price upon, or Sell or Expose to Sale, any
Book or Books at such a Price or Rate as shall be Conceived by any
Person or Persons to be High and Unreasonable; It shall and may be

Printers, and to Examine and Enquire of the reason of the Dearness and
Inhauncement of the Price or Value of such Book or Books by him or them
so Sold or Exposed to Sale; and if upon such Enquiry and Examination it
shall be found, that the Price of such Book or Books is Inhaunced, or

any wise too High or Unreasonable, Then and in such case, the said
Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, Bishop of
London, two Chief Justices, Chief Baron, Vice Chancellors of the
Universities, in that part of Great Britain called England, and the said
Lord President of the Sessions, Lord Justice General, Lord Chief Baron,

Anno Octavo
AnnRegin

An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vest-
ing the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or
Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein
mentioned.

Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other
Persons, have of late frequently taken
the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting,
and Publishing, or causing to be Print-
ed, Reprinted, and Published Books,
and other Writings, without the Con-
sent of the Authors or Proprietors of
such Books and Writings, to their
very great Detriment, and too often
to the Ruin of them and their Fami-
lies: For Preventing therefore such
Practices for the future, and for the
Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write use-
ful Books; May it please Your Majesty, that it may be En-
acted, and be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty,
by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled,
and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the
Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, the
Author of any Book or Books already Printed, who hath not
Transferred to any other the Copy or Copies of such Book or
Books, Share or Shares thereof, or the Bookseller or Book-
sellers, Printer or Printers, or other Person or Persons, who
hath or have Purchased or Acquired the Copy or Copies of any
Book or Books, in order to Print or Reprint the same, shall
have the sole Right and Liberty of Printing such Book and
Books for the Term of One and twenty Years, to Commence
from the said Tenth Day of April, and no longer; and that
the Author of any Book or Books already Composed and not
Printed and Published, or that shall hereafter be Composed, and
his Assignee, or Assigns, shall have the sole Liberty of Printing
and Reprinting such Book and Books for the Term of four
-teen

teen Years, to Commence from the Day of the First Publish-
ing the same, and no longer; And that if any other Bookseller,
Printer, or other Person whatsoever, from and after the Tenth
Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, within the
times Granted and Limited by this Act, as aforesaid, shall Print,
Reprint, or Import, or cause to be Printed, Reprinted, or Imported
any such Book or Books, without the Consent of the Proprietor or
Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing, Signed
in the Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses; or knowing
the same to be so Printed or Reprinted, without the Consent of
the Proprietors, shall Sell, Publish, or Expose to Sale, or cause
to be Sold, Published, or Exposed to Sale, any such Book or
Books, without such Consent first had and obtained, as afore-
said, Then such Offender or Offenders shall Forfeit such Book or
Books, and all and every Sheet or Sheets, being part of such
Book or Books, to the Proprietor or Proprietors of the Copy
thereof, who shall forthwith Damask and make Waste-Paper of
them: And further, That every such Offender or Offenders, shall
Forfeit One Peny [sic] for every sheet which shall be found in his,
her, or their Custody, either Printed or Printing, Published or
Exposed to Sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of
this Act, the one Moiety thereof to the Queens [sic] most Excellent
Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety
thereof to any Person or Persons that shall Sue for the same,
to be Recovered in any of Her Majesties [sic] Courts of Record at
Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information,
in which no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege, or Protection,
or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.

And whereas many Persons may through Ignorance Offend
against this Act, unless some Provision be made whereby the Pro-
perty in every such Book, as is intended by this Act to be Se-
cured to the proprietor or Proprietors thereof, may be ascertain-
ed, as likewise the Consent of such Proprietor or Proprietors for the
Printing or Reprinting of such Book or Books may from time
to time be known; Be it therefore further Enacted by the Au-
thority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall be
construed to extend to subject any Bookseller, Printer, or other
Person whatsoever, to the Forfeitures or Penalties therein men-
tioned, for or by reason of the Printing or Reprinting of any Book
or Books without such Consent, as aforesaid, unless the Title
to the Copy of such Book or Books hereafter Published shall,
before such Publication be Entred [sic], in the Register-Book of the
Company of Stationers, in such manner as hath been usual,
which Register-Book shall at all times be kept at the Hall of
the said Company, and unless such Consent of the Proprietor
or Proprietors be in like manner Entred [sic], as aforesaid, for every
of which several Entries, Six Pence shall be Paid, and no
more; which said Register-Book may, at all Seasonable [sic; should be:

Reasonable] and
Convenient times, be Resorted to, and Inspected by any Book-
seller, Printer, or other Person, for the Purposes before menti-
oned,

Company of Stationers, shall, when and as often as thereunto
required, give a Certificate under his Hand of such Entry or En-
tries, and for every such Certificate, may take a Fee not exceed-
ing Six Pence.

Provided nevertheless, That if the Clerk of the said Com-
pany of Stationers, for the time being shall Refuse or Neglect to
Register, or make such Entry or Entries, or to give such Cer-
tificate, being thereunto Required by the Author or Proprietor of
such Copy or Copies, in the Presence of Two or more Credible
Witnesses, That then such Person and Persons so refusing, No-
tice being first duly given of such Refusal, by an Advertisement
in the Gazette, shall have the like Benefit, as if such Entry or
Entries, Certificate or Certificates had been duly made and gi-
ven; and that the Clerks so refusing, shall, for any such Offence,
Forfeit to the Proprietor of such Copy or Copies the Sum of
Twenty Pounds, to be Recovered in any of Her Majesties [sic]
Courts of Record at Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill,
Plaint, or Information, in which no Wager of Law, Essoign,
Privilege or Protection, or more than one Imparlance shall
be allowed.

Provided nevertheless, and it is hereby further Enacted by
the Authority aforesaid, That if any Bookseller or Booksellers,
Printer or Printers, shall, after the said Five and twentieth
Day of March, One thousand seven hundred and ten, set a
Price upon, or Sell or Expose to Sale, any Book or Books

sellers, Printer or Printers, and to Examine and Enquire of
the reason of the Dearness and Inhauncement of the Price or Va-
lue of such Book or Books by him or them so Sold or Exposed to
Sale; and if upon such Enquiry and Examination it shall be
